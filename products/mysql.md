> [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/about) is an open source database developed by Oracle. With its proven performance, reliability and ease-of-use, MySQL has become the leading database choice for web-based applications, used by high profile web properties including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Yahoo! and many more.

[Oracle's Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.mysql.com/support/) has three options.

## Premier Support

5 years, starting at <abbr title="General Availability">GA</abbr>, of Premier Support that includes MySQL maintenance releases, updates, fixes (error correction), and security alerts.

## Extended Support

3 years of extra support including error correction, beyond the Premier Support period, for specific MySQL releases. Includes MySQL maintenance releases, updates, bug fixes (error correction), and security alerts.

## Sustaining Support

Any time, beyond the Premier Support period. Support only. No new releases, no new fixes (no error correction for new issues), no new updates. Only pre-existing updates, fixes and alerts are available.

## Community Edition

[MySQL Community Edition](https://www.mysql.com/products/community/) is freely available under GPLv2 licensing. Historically, patches have been released at the same time as for the commercial offerings, but no official commitment is made that such a policy will remain.
